<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>
  The Online Autograder is a hosted platform with separate clients for instructors and students. 
  Instructors manage assignments and view results through their client; students download 
  the student client to submit their work.
</p>

<h2>Instructor Client</h2>
<p>
  The instructor client is your command center for managing assignments, test cases, and 
  viewing student results. Request an account to get started.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create and manage grading assignments</li>
  <li>Upload test cases and configure grading criteria</li>
  <li>View student submission results in real time</li>
  <li>Manage your class roster</li>
</ul>

<h2>Student Client</h2>
<p>
  Students download the student client and use it to submit their Python assignments 
  directly to the grading server. Results are returned immediately.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Submit assignments directly from the client</li>
  <li>Receive grading feedback instantly</li>
  <li>No account setup required for students — login provided by instructor</li>
</ul>
