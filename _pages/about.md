  - title: The Project
    body: >
      PyAutoGrader is a Python autograding tool built to make grading programming assignments
      less tedious for instructors and more informative for students. It started as a practical
      solution to a real problem: running test suites against student code by hand takes too long,
      and existing tools either require too much setup or do not fit neatly into a classroom workflow.

  - title: Two Products, One Goal
    body: >
      The Offline Autograder is for instructors who want something simple and self-contained.
      Build an executable, hand it to your students, done. No accounts, no servers, no dependencies
      on outside services. The Online Autograder is for instructors who want more — centralized
      submission tracking, real-time results, and a proper client experience for students.
      It runs on a hosted server managed by the project author.

  - title: Development
    body: >
      PyAutoGrader is actively developed and maintained. The programs are developed in separate
      repositories under the PyAutoGrader GitHub organization at github.com/PyAutoGrader.
      This site lives at pyautograder.github.io.
