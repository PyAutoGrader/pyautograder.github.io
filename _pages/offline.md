  - title: How It Works
    body: >
      The Offline Autograder gives instructors a way to distribute a self-contained grading
      executable to their students. Students run the executable locally against their
      assignment code — no internet connection or accounts needed.

  - title: For Instructors
    body: >
      Using PyAutoGrader's tooling, you write your test cases and then build a standalone
      executable. Distribute it however you like — via your LMS, email, or a class file share.
      Students run it themselves.
    items:
      - Write test cases in Python
      - Build a distributable executable with a single command
      - No server setup or infrastructure required
      - Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

  - title: For Students
    body: >
      Students receive the executable from their instructor and run it against their
      assignment submission. They get immediate pass/fail feedback on each test case.
    items:
      - No installation of special software required
      - Run the grader from the terminal or file explorer
      - See which tests passed and which failed
      - Works entirely offline
