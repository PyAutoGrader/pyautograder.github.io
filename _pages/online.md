  title: How It Works
  body: >
    The Online Autograder has two clients — one for instructors and one for students — both
    communicating with a hosted server. The server stores all assignment data, class rosters,
    and submission results. Grading itself runs locally on the student's machine, keeping
    things fast and reducing server load.

    configure grading criteria, and view student results. You will need an instructor
