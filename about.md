<h2>The Project</h2>
<p>
  PyAutoGrader is a Python autograding tool built to make grading programming assignments 
  less tedious for instructors and more informative for students. It started as a practical 
  solution to a real problem: running test suites against student code by hand takes too long, 
  and existing tools either require too much setup or don't fit neatly into a classroom workflow.
</p>

<h2>Two Products, One Goal</h2>
<p>
  The <strong>Offline Autograder</strong> is for instructors who want something simple and 
  self-contained. Build an executable, hand it to your students, done. No accounts, no servers, 
  no dependencies on outside services.
</p>
<p>
  The <strong>Online Autograder</strong> is for instructors who want more — centralized 
  submission tracking, real-time results, and a proper client experience for students. 
  It runs on a hosted server managed by the project author.
</p>

<h2>Development</h2>
<p>
  PyAutoGrader is actively developed and maintained. The programs are developed in 
  separate repositories under the 
  <a href="https://github.com/PyAutoGrader" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PyAutoGrader GitHub organization</a>. 
  This site lives at <code>pyautograder.github.io</code>.
