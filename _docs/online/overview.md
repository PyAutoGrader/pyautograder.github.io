The Online Autograder is a hosted grading platform. Instructors use the instructor client to manage assignments and view results. Students use the student client to submit work.

## Components

**Instructor Client** — Desktop application for instructors. Manage assignments, upload test cases, view student results.

**Student Client** — Desktop application for students. Submit Python files for grading and receive immediate feedback.

**Grading Server** — Hosted and managed by PyAutoGrader. You do not need to run your own server.

## When to Use the Online Autograder

- You want centralized result tracking
- You have a larger class and want submissions organized in one place
- You want students to submit through a proper client rather than running an executable

## Getting Access

Instructor accounts are available by request. [Contact us](/contact/) to get set up.
