Welcome to the PyAutoGrader documentation. This site covers both the **Offline Autograder** and the **Online Autograder**.

## Choose Your Product

**Offline Autograder** — If your instructor distributes a grading executable, or if you're an instructor who wants a simple, self-contained grading tool, start with the Offline docs.

**Online Autograder** — If you're an instructor using the hosted platform, or a student submitting assignments through the student client, start with the Online docs.
