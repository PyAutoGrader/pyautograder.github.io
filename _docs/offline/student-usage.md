## How Students Use the Offline Grader

1. Receive the executable from your instructor
2. Place it in the same directory as your Python assignment file
3. Run the executable from the terminal or by double-clicking (OS dependent)
4. Review your test results

## Understanding Your Results

The grader will print which tests passed and which failed, along with a final score. You do not need to install anything — the executable is self-contained.

Full instructions with screenshots will be added here when the first release is available.
