## Overview

Once your test cases are written and your grader is configured, you'll run a build command that packages everything into a standalone executable for your target platform.

Topics that will be covered here:

- Running the build command
- Choosing a target platform (Windows / macOS / Linux)
- What the output executable looks like
- How to test the executable before distributing it
- How to distribute it to students (LMS, email, file share)
